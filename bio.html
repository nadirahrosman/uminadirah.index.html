                  <h3>About Myself</h3> 
                  <p style="margin-left: center ;"> I am a self-assured individual. I am confident that if a task is completed correctly and with hard work, I will be able to give it my all. Prayer is also an important part in achieving success.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                    Furthermore, I prefer to complete my chores in an organised manner. As a result, I'll carry out my daily activities according to the daily schedule I've created. It also assists me in effectively managing my time because I always know what I need to do at specific times. As a result, I was able to save time. As a student with obligations, good time management is critical to me.
                <br>
                <br>
                  I enjoy reading novels in my leisure time. Novels, magazines, and fiction books were among the reading things that I gravitated toward. I enjoy reading because it provides me with a sense of accomplishment. Besides, I enjoy perusing the internet and reading to learn more about professional vocations that I might pursue in the future. I want to learn more about a profession before pursuing it so that I may make selections based on my interests.
                <br>
                <br>
                  Moreover, I am a person who really admires the beauty of the sky, whether from the beauty of sunrise and sunset, the position of the clouds and everything about the shape of the sky. I really like going to the beach because of the peace that I will get while being there. It can be said that almost 60% of the pictures in my gallery are filled with pictures of the sky and the beach. XOXO
